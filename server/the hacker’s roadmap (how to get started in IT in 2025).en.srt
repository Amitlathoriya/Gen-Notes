1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
Here is the roadmap to
get started in it in 2025,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,820
and it's been two years since
I've made a video on this.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,700
Some things have changed, but first
let's talk about what hasn't changed.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,170
This roadmap is aimed at getting you a
job in it fast and on the path to landing

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:13,890
your dream job.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,280
Six figures is absolutely within reach
and you'll be surprised at how fast you

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,470
can get there. No gimmicks. No shortcuts,

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,760
just hard work on a clear path and also
no college. You don't need it. Now,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,850
similar to our last roadmap, the
first three phases are for you.

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,780
They're for everyone.

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,440
The skills you learn here are foundational
to it no matter what path you go

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,450
down, but after that,
the world is your oyster.

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,730
What I mean is that you can
go down many different paths.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,780
I can't cover them all here,

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,480
but I will be talking about one of the
most exciting ones, the coolest ones,

16
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,890
the ones you see on tv. Cybersecurity
specifically. How do you become a hacker?

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,460
Ethically, of course, and also,
please know this may be a roadmap,

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,240
but you don't necessarily have to drive
all the way down in the same order.

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,910
In fact, you may find a shortcut.
We'll talk more about that later.

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,010
And just so you know, this
roadmap is hacker approved.

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,380
John Hammond looked at it and said, yes.

22
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,570
This is John Hammond approved.

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,090
So here we go. Phase one.
Actually, no, no Phase zero. Yeah,

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,900
we're doing things different this year
and this might feel weird for phase zero.

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,480
I want you to start
applying for jobs right now.

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,240
I don't care that you know
nothing. That's okay. I get it.

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,370
It feels a bit cart before
horse, but lemme tell you,

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,940
you don't need IT skills to
get that first job in it.

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,490
Now I know many of these
entry-level IT help desk jobs.

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,100
It seems like they're asking
for a lot. Look at this one,

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,350
a help desk specialist in Houston, Texas.

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,180
They want you to have a year experience.

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,820
They want you to have some
strong technical skills already,

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,480
but really all they care
about is excellent customer
service skills. Trust me.

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,310
Alright, come here. Can
I tell you a secret?

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,080
I got my first IT job without a
certification to my name or really any IT

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,800
skills,

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,550
but I did have some fast
food job experience and I
was hungry not for fast food

39
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,210
but for IT, for learning and proving
that I could be of value to that company.

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,480
Now,

41
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,870
the reason I want you to apply for IT
help desk or technical support roles is

42
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,140
that it's the first job for most
people in it. It's entry level.

43
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,570
Can you skip it? It's possible. In fact,

44
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,030
I encourage you to apply
for jobs above that.

45
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,420
It's not going to hurt anything and you
never know, but if you're fresh green,

46
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,850
just getting started, help
desk is an amazing place to be.

47
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,120
You'll learn so much and you're not going
to be there for very long unless you

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,190
want to be. Help desk is
pretty fun. At that point,

49
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,840
it was the best job I ever had.

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,780
I actually had fun going to work
and I really didn't want to leave.

51
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,430
So right now, if you want
to get started in it,

52
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,090
polish up that resume for what you
want to do, not what you have done.

53
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,090
Tailor your experience to be
very IT focused. For example,

54
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,150
I worked at Starbucks, but you better
believe on that resume I put on there,

55
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,660
I fix their printer all the time. I
was the guy they would go to Chuck,

56
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,780
the printer's broken again. I
got you guys also on my resume.

57
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,560
I was very upfront about what I was
working towards, what I was studying.

58
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,170
We'll talk about that here in a moment
and if you want examples of what that

59
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:43,740
might look like,

60
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,680
I do have a video where I broke down
some really awesome resumes and reviewed

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,620
some LinkedIn profiles. Check those
out here somewhere. The holdup.

62
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,310
Why are we doing this?

63
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,580
Why are we getting a job immediately
before we learn anything? This reason,

64
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,640
experience is king. It's gold.

65
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,680
Nothing looks better on your
resume than experience. Also,

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,980
what you learn on that job will be more
valuable than anything else you study.

67
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,820
So phase zero,

68
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,490
polish up that resume and make
your LinkedIn profile look awesome.

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,460
Start applying for jobs right now,
right after this video. Seriously,

70
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,880
it'll take you a couple hours and
maintain a habit of regularly applying for

71
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,700
jobs until you get that job. And guess
what? It's okay if you don't get it.

72
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,890
It's okay if you go on an
interview and you fail.

73
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,550
You're learning so much in this process
and you're meeting people also just

74
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,370
going through all these different jobs
and seeing the descriptions and what

75
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,580
they're looking for will teach you
a lot. And also kind of a footnote,

76
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,570
one more thing you want to do is
start networking the social kind,

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,880
acquaint yourself with the IT world.

78
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,180
Start following people on Twitter and
get into Discord and start talking to

79
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,710
people who are like you, who are studying.

80
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,470
Start talking to people who
are above you, who are mentors.

81
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,410
The old adage is true.
It's not what it's who.

82
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,920
Most of the jobs I've gotten have been
through relationships that I've built.

83
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,480
I know phase zero is weird.

84
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,970
Might feel like a waste of time right now
because all you want to do is learn it

85
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,180
because it's awesome. Don't
skip this if you're serious.

86
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,690
So if you're in a place right now to
where you can get a job and start working

87
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,860
in it, if that's really what you want
to do, phase zero, man, say it with me.

88
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,270
Phase zero. Sorry,

89
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,420
phase one now I don't want you to move
on until you've applied for at least two

90
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,390
jobs. Also, leave a comment
below if you get a job. Oh,

91
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,240
I'd be so excited to hear that and
how encouraging will that be for other

92
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,140
people? Just do that. Now, phase one
compared to my last video in 2023,

93
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,700
it's changed a little bit,

94
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,380
but it's still going to be
about foundations developing
those core IT skills.

95
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,200
Now I'm a big believer
in IT certifications and
what they can do for your

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,330
career. You'll see many
of these on the roadmap.

97
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,660
The first one I recommend for
foundations is the compt A plus.

98
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,750
This essentially is the help
desk certification that's
going to help you land

99
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,450
that first job. Can you skip it? We'll
talk about that here in a second,

100
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,640
but here's what you're going to learn
and actually there's a new one they just

101
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,260
came out with launching Spring 2025
exciting. But the A plus is an IT buffet.

102
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,480
They're going to teach you so many things,

103
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,180
which is great because when
you first get started in it,

104
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,140
you may not know which path you want to
go down and there are a billion paths.

105
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,600
The a plus gives you a
chance to sample everything.

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,220
Programming may be a bit dry,

107
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,190
but networking is delicious and
you'll never know until you try it.

108
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,280
Now for most people, getting the
A plus certification is not easy.

109
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,140
It's a lot of information contained in
two exams each costing you $253 and yes,

110
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,480
that's per exam and that's
for the current exams.

111
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,120
I'm not sure what the 2025
exams will cost. We'll see.

112
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,010
Now I know for someone just starting out,

113
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,020
this is a lot and that
was the case for me.

114
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,220
I even failed one exam and had to
retake it paying more money. That hurt.

115
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,370
So it begs the question, is this worth
it? Do you actually need the exam?

116
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,350
Can't you just go study the knowledge,
learn it, save some money? Yeah, you can,

117
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,320
but here's the problem. How are
you going to prove that knowledge?

118
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,060
How are you going to prove
that to the hiring manager?

119
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,240
That's what the a plus is for. Compt
has done all the marketing for you.

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,840
They tell people, Hey, if someone has
this cert, they know everything. So hr,

121
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,120
all they have to do is go,
oh, Aaron has the a plus.

122
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,320
He can probably do this help desk job.
It gets you past that HR filter. So TLDR,

123
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,470
you need the knowledge
certification. It's optional,

124
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,110
but it'll help you get that foot in
the door and land that first job.

125
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,540
Now how do you get the A plus?
Where do you learn this stuff from?

126
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,330
There are free and paid options for
free. You can't beat Professor Messer.

127
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,540
He has an entire A plus course on
YouTube. You can watch it right now.

128
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,350
Now for a paid option, there's IT
Pro tv, which I love. Link below.

129
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,610
Actually now it's called IT Pro and also
this will be a shameless plug for me.

130
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,580
I'm building something which
means it's not done yet,

131
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,850
but it's going to be kind of different.
You'll see. Just keep in mind,

132
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,180
it is still in the building phase and
part of this new thing, my academy,

133
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,240
there'll be an entire
CompTIA a plus course,

134
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,330
a training series that I'm pouring
my blood, sweat, and coffee into.

135
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,870
It's something that I wish would've
been around when I first started my IT

136
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,160
career and started learning.

137
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,520
So if you like to start studying this
as we're building it, check it out.

138
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,090
Link below.

139
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,120
It's currently 12 bucks a month and
every penny is going towards making this

140
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,050
thing awesome. And yes, I will be
covering the 2025 compt a plus exams.

141
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,930
Now the goal with phase one is to get
your a plus or at least equivalent

142
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,580
knowledge, but we're not quite done yet.

143
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,170
This is where my roadmap's going to start
being a little weird compared to 2023,

144
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,490
and by weird I mean awesome.

145
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,040
Now this is optional because I
don't want you to be overwhelmed,

146
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,960
but while you're studying for your A plus,

147
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,320
I want you to start learning
Linux and not just Linux.

148
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,270
I want you to start
learning coding as well,

149
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,120
specifically either Python
or go Python's the favorite.

150
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,960
So I go with that Python, I don't
want to be confusing. Now again,

151
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,940
getting the A plus is
still your main focus,

152
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,970
but I want you to start becoming
familiar with Linux and Python.

153
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,340
Now what does that look like? How are
you going to do that? Start simple.

154
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,480
Maybe one day a week.

155
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,310
Saturdays you'll spend 30 minutes
learning Linux and 30 minutes learning

156
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,100
Python or an hour each, two hours each.

157
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,530
I don't really care what you
do as long as you do something.

158
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,360
Now where do you learn?
What are the resources?

159
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,520
There are a bajillion out there for Linux.

160
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,410
I have a free Linux for Hackers course.

161
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,740
You could watch one episode a week for
Python. I have a Python for everyone.

162
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,890
Course these are both free on YouTube
by the way. Now why Linux and coding?

163
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,800
Well, you're going to see this
everywhere at every step of your journey,

164
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,130
start learning it now again,
even if it's just a little bit.

165
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,580
Now we're not done with phase
one yet. You thought we were.

166
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,870
We're not also in phase one. I want you
to start building out your home lab.

167
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,930
This is where you get a chance to put
into practice everything you're learning.

168
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,650
Don't just learn the theory, take
notes and memorize things. No,

169
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,720
do the things. For example,

170
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,140
when you're learning about virtual
machines in the a plus in your home lab,

171
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,870
install virtual box and
set up a virtual machine.

172
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,240
Install Ubuntu as part
of your Linux practice.

173
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,760
When you're learning about networks,
install a router in your house.

174
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,640
Replace your home router with
PF sense. Install a DNS server.

175
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,720
Most if not all of these things can be
done for free and it's going to be this.

176
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,553
Check this out.

177
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,670
I call these projects resume building
moments because you know what else you're

178
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,750
going to be doing in phase one.

179
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,150
You're going to be applying for
jobs if you don't already have one.

180
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,000
Keep applying. Keep refining your resume.

181
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,580
When you deploy a DNS
server into your home,

182
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,900
put on your resume a project that you
deployed a DNS server into your house.

183
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,560
That's cool. That's real tech,
that's real it lemme tell you,

184
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,090
if you have a home lab, you look good.
That communicates passion and drive.

185
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:47,690
Man.

186
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,770
When I saw resumes or people were putting
their own projects in their house on

187
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,603
their resume,

188
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,970
I love hiring those types of people
that they are passionate about this.

189
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,110
Even when they go home,

190
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,710
I know they're going to be thinking about
this stuff and learning and growing.

191
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,910
That's what employers want and
that's surprisingly hard to hire for.

192
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,440
So if you can demonstrate that,
oh my gosh. Now I know phase one,

193
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,870
that's a luck, right? Feel
free to cut some things out.

194
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,380
If all you can manage is the a
plus during this time, that's fine.

195
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,160
You can do these in order. Finish your
A plus the Newsome, Lins and Python,

196
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,840
implement some home lab ideas.

197
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,240
It's up to you where you can
do it all within one week.

198
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,860
Now to fully graduate from phase one,

199
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,920
I'm estimating it'll take you
roughly two to three months.

200
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,130
Of course this will vary based
on your life, your schedule,

201
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,800
how much time you have, but if
you work hard, you can do it,

202
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,770
but two to three months if you maintain
a pretty consistent study schedule

203
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,280
should be good. Now on to phase two. Yes,
we're finally moving on to phase two.

204
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,610
I know phase two is all about dipping
your toes in the security water.

205
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,530
It's kind of a cool brand name dibs.

206
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,700
The focal point of this phase is gaining
the security plus from CompTIA. Yes,

207
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,310
another IT certification,
but this thing looks really,

208
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,740
really good on your resume,
similar to the A plus,

209
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,170
the security plus will teach
you a ton of information,

210
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,960
but here it's security focused.
They might be thinking, Chuck,

211
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,510
I'm not going into hacking. I
don't want to be a security expert.

212
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,310
Why do I have to learn this? Listen,

213
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,480
security will be part of every IT role
you have. The more you know about it,

214
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,510
the better. And for phase two, we're
not going super deep into security,

215
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,050
but we're giving you enough knowledge
and enough credentials to find in land an

216
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,140
amazing job. Now, why security
plus why another certification?

217
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,125
This looker is going to do two things
for you. Knowledge, there's a ton of it.

218
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,050
This is a security buffet
and similar to the a plus,

219
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,120
you're going to find out
about roles and paths,

220
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,410
but just cybersecurity that you
didn't know existed. It's a big world.

221
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,040
Number two, this is definitely a
checkbox cert. What does that mean?

222
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,860
A lot of companies want
you to have this. In fact,

223
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,410
this is one of the most popular certs
for people who want to work for the

224
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,460
government in any capacity because
it satisfies the DOD 85 70 directive,

225
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,730
which lays out the minimum requirements
for IT and cybersecurity roles.

226
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,550
The security plus is the
easiest way to check that box.

227
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,400
You'll find that most roles just
want you to have it by default.

228
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,360
Currently the security plus will cost
you $404 and that's just one exam.

229
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,373
And again, yes,

230
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,440
you can learn the knowledge within
the security plus without getting the

231
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,220
certification, but the certification
looks really good on your resume.

232
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,790
Now where can you study for the security?
Plus again, free and paid options,

233
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
free Professor master coming in,

234
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,820
he has an entire security plus course
for free on YouTube for a paid option.

235
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,430
I do recommend it Pro and know
they're not sponsoring this video.

236
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,530
I just really do like
them. And full disclosure,

237
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,540
the link below will be an affiliate link,

238
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,430
meaning that when you sign
up you don't pay anymore,

239
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,680
but I do get a small kickback
for telling you about 'em.

240
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,020
Now while the focal point
of phase two is security,

241
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,930
plus there's going to be more
Linux. Linux becomes very,

242
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,840
very important in this phase. And
because we're in the security phase,

243
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,480
let's have you do some Linux
that's security focused.

244
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,340
There's a free site called Over the wire.

245
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,550
This place is amazing and they
have a path called Bandit,

246
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,910
which when you go through it will teach
you a ton of Linux basics. It's amazing,

247
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,580
very, very fun. Check it
out. Also in this phase,

248
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,750
no surprise is more coding Python at
this phase, keep learning the basics,

249
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,750
but then I want you to challenge
yourself to build some kind of thing,

250
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,750
a project. Think something that
you could add to your resume.

251
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,890
Another resume building moment. One idea
is to build a simple network scanner,

252
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,890
scan your network and look for
open ports using Python. And again,

253
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,940
similar to phase one, don't stress about
the Python and Linux side of things.

254
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,000
Focus on security plus get that
on your resume. But if can,

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,360
if it doesn't overwhelm you, one to
two hours a week more. If you're crazy,

256
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,250
the more Linux and Python you learn,

257
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,200
the better It's going
to be awesome for you.

258
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,540
And at this point I'm going to
start sounding like a broken record.

259
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,800
Do some home lab stuff,

260
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,350
what you're learning in the security plus
what you're learning through Linux and

261
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,870
Python. Do some things in your home lab.

262
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,940
Automate some things
with Linux and Python.

263
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,500
Get on YouTube and look for fun projects.

264
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,360
I do all kinds of stuff in the home lab.

265
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,150
Just do something and add it
to your resume. And finally,

266
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,210
keep applying for stinking jobs
if you don't already have one.

267
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,340
And always keep that resume up to date.

268
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,100
This space should roughly take you two
to three months and I know what you're

269
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,170
probably thinking. I would be
thinking the same thing. Chuck,

270
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,840
you're being very vague about how
much Linux and Python to learn.

271
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,930
How much do I do in my home
lab? I'm doing that on purpose.

272
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,230
I don't want to overwhelm you also,
that would make this video way too long.

273
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,860
But if you'd like me to make a more
detailed roadmap where I'm like at this

274
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,200
point do this project, at this point
you should know this much Python.

275
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,850
If you'd like to see that, let me know.

276
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,330
That may be a video I make in the future.
So phase two, two to three months,

277
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,300
which of course will be determined
by how much time you have and other

278
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,900
variables.

279
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,320
It's time for a coffee break and this
coffee break in this video is sponsored by

280
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,160
Bamboo Labs,

281
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,520
which I'm actually really excited to
talk about because I've been using Bamboo

282
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,060
Labs forever. They're one of the
first 3D printers I ever bought.

283
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,120
And the reason I'm excited is because
they're going to help you with your resume

284
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,270
building moments, the chance for you
to shine and show off your home labs.

285
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,430
I got into 3D printing about maybe two,

286
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,030
three years ago and I bought
this 3D printer. I hated it.

287
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,750
Took me forever to set up, almost pulled
out my beard, thank goodness I didn't.

288
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,930
And the printing was slow, so I'm like
there's got to be something better.

289
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,630
And that's when I found Bamboo
Labs. I bought this one.

290
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,410
I don't think I worked for two weeks. I
would just stand there and watch things.

291
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,300
Print Bamboo Labs is one of those ones
that it's advanced enough to make you

292
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,510
excited about diving deeper, but it's
simple enough for anyone to approach it.

293
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,510
Like someone in my church, he just
bought a 3D printer for his kids.

294
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,910
They set it up and just started
printing everything. In fact,

295
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,760
they bought this one here.
The Bamboo Labs a one combo.

296
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,780
This thing is ridiculous,
super fast, easy to set up.

297
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,690
My team can set it up and they're
not the most technical people.

298
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,510
They're working on it. And the deal on
this thing at the time of this video,

299
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,470
it's $489 for the printer
and then this a MS light.

300
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,670
What that means is that you
can do multicolor prints,
you can design your model,

301
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,390
slice it with a bunch of colors and
it'll just change it out for you.

302
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,530
Now back to home lab stuff. You can
make your home lab that much more great.

303
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,320
Make your resume building
moments a bit prettier,

304
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,070
a bit more functional with a 3D printer.
So when I did my travel mass video,

305
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,230
I needed something that
would house all my stuff,

306
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,180
my SSDs and everything
printed that sucker.

307
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,820
And then me and my team 3D printed a
few more things just to give you some

308
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,300
ideas. This raspberry pie case,
sure you can buy a case online,

309
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,120
but making your own, printing
your own, that's way cooler.

310
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,100
It's SSD Mount for maybe whatever
server you're going to be building,

311
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,890
not as flashy but functional.
This SD card holder,

312
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,570
I've actually printed a
few of these in the past.

313
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,750
We legit use these every day and as
you're building out your home lab,

314
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,950
you'll probably end up having a rack.

315
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,730
So you'll want to rack mount
your raspberry pie, print
that and check this out.

316
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,080
They have this thing called Maker World.

317
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,110
It's a world full of things you can print
and what makes it special is that when

318
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,040
you select one of these,

319
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,910
you don't have to change any of the
settings or alter it for your specific

320
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,770
printer, which you used to have to do. No,

321
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,350
you just select your printer and
the settings are already there.

322
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,690
So thanks again to Bamboo Labs
for sponsoring this video.

323
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,890
If you want this A one combo,

324
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,710
check out my link below and
now back to the roadmap.

325
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,470
Now before we move on to phase three,

326
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,200
just know that in phase one and phase
two should also be continuing with

327
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,040
networking, social networking, keep
talking to people, keep rubbing shoulders.

328
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:34,640
Again,

329
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,420
you never know who is going to be
responsible for getting you that next job,

330
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,600
make friends, make contacts.
Now speaking of networking,

331
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,230
let's talk about phase three. It's
all networking. My favorite part,

332
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,880
networking is the bread and butter of it.

333
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,890
You have to know it and
when you get into it,

334
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,010
you'll find out that you love to
know it. Networking is the best part.

335
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,130
I know it's completely subjective and
I'm completely biased. Network, Chuck.

336
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,680
I mean you saw it coming, right?
But you don't want to skip this.

337
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,800
It's like eating your vegetables,
except these vegetables are delicious.

338
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,660
Now with networking similar
to our other phases,

339
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,550
we're going to focus on
a certification here.

340
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,100
We actually have a couple of options.
Now, if you saw my last video,

341
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,300
there won't be a big surprise here.

342
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,390
My favorite networking
certification is the Cisco CNA.

343
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,590
This sucker right here is probably one
of the best certifications you can get

344
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,340
and put on your resume period. This
chumps 'em all at this level. Anyway,

345
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,250
employers love this one.
It's the gold standard,

346
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,670
but there is another option I want to
shout out. And that's the CompTIA Network.

347
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,790
Plus it's another very, very popular
networking certification. Now,

348
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,870
why would you choose one over the
other? Well, Cisco, it's harder.

349
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,060
It's going to take you more
time, take you more study,

350
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,380
it might kick your butt a bit more.

351
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,120
But the CNA is more valuable probably
because it's harder and demonstrates

352
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,200
practical skills.

353
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,220
And one of the reasons it's so practical
is because it's Cisco focused with the

354
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,520
certification, you're going to
learn networking inside and out,

355
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,480
but you're also going to be learning
how to use Cisco products, their CLI.

356
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,960
You'll be learning about their automation
products, their security products.

357
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,450
So this is the no-brainer if you're
going to go down the network engineering

358
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,090
path or network admin path. But
if you're going somewhere else,

359
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,990
CNA might be a bit too much for you.
That's where the Network plus comes in.

360
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,560
It's vendor neutral so you're not focusing
on any one vendor and you'll still

361
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,860
pick up networking knowledge, learning
what a router is, a switch subnetting,

362
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,370
they'll both look great on your resume.
CCNA will make you look better. Also,

363
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,490
it will only help you to know how
to use Cisco stuff because Cisco is

364
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,350
everywhere. A ton of companies use them.

365
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,440
They have been dominant for a long
time. Let's talk about pricing.

366
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,960
The Network plus will cost you $369.

367
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,870
It is one exam and the
CCNA will cost you $300.

368
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,810
So it actually is the better deal
even though it's harder. Now,

369
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,990
where do you go to learn? Where can
you learn this stuff for Network Plus,

370
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,390
similar to the other
CompTIA certifications,

371
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,160
professor Messer co and Clutch has a
free network plus course on YouTube for

372
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,730
paid IT Pro has a pretty good network
plus course. And then for the CC NA,

373
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,590
I'm actually really excited
to tell you about this.

374
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,780
There is a and paid option free.
There's a channel called Jeremy's,

375
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,830
IT Labs on YouTube and he has
an entire course CCNA for free,

376
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,100
which is kind of insane because the
CC NA is very, very hard to teach.

377
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,160
It's a lot of content. And Jeremy's a
friend of mine, he's an awesome dude.

378
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,710
He also lives in Japan, which is
very cool. After the paid option,

379
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,580
this is what I'm excited
about. I mentioned my academy
earlier, my new thing,

380
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,740
I'm building the thing that's
going to be different. Well,

381
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,290
I'm not building it alone and I don't
think I've publicly announced this to

382
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,990
anyone yet. So you're first to hear,

383
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,480
I've partnered with a guy
who taught me networking.

384
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,470
That's where I learned everything.

385
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:24,450
I know he's the guy who got me so excited
about it and really he's responsible

386
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,560
for what I'm doing today. His name
is Jeremy Charra. He's A-C-C-I-E.

387
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,640
Incredible teacher.

388
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,390
He's where I learned how to teach and
he has created the most amazing CCNA

389
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,230
course, the best one he's ever made on
our academy. So similar to the A plus,

390
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,200
it is currently on the academy.
We're still in our building phase,

391
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,040
but you can go there right now and
become part of this as we're building it.

392
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,430
But please keep in mind disclaimer,
it's not completely ready yet.

393
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,323
We're building it,

394
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,840
but I would love for you to come check
it out and become part of what we're

395
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,390
doing. It is going to be something
different. That's all I can tell you now.

396
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,670
So pick your poison CC A or Network Plus,

397
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,060
and then you probably saw this
coming more Python and more Linux.

398
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,200
And in the networking phase,

399
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,980
try to make your Linux and Python
study be networking focused.

400
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,910
A big part of the Cisco CC
NA is network automation,

401
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,880
which largely involves
doing things with Python,

402
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,180
logging into routers and switches
and automating things they can do.

403
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,590
It's very fun. Set aside two to three
hours a week and just spend time with it.

404
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,360
Continue to get familiar with the Linux
terminal programming and Python and just

405
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,010
let those skills compliment the main
focus, which here is networking. Again,

406
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,910
doing this is going to make you super
human. You're going to be amazing.

407
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,070
I mean you already are, but this
will make you that much better.

408
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,020
And of course in this phase
we'll be doing more home.

409
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,760
But here I want to give you a
challenge. We mentioned in phase one,

410
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,200
replacing your router with PF
sense as an option. And this phase,

411
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,050
I want to challenge you to actually
do this. This is your homework.

412
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,350
Replace your home network
with another network.

413
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,470
This could be buying old
Cisco stuff off eBay.

414
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,590
This could be putting a PF sense
router in installing Unify.

415
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,690
And then I want you to do things
like monitor your network,

416
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,480
monitor your internet quality,
be really nerdy about it,

417
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,830
and then all that stuff you're doing,

418
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,160
slap that onto a resume and keep
applying for jobs. And then of course,

419
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,320
keep networking. Keep talking
to people. Keep hanging out.

420
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,950
Now how long this phase will take you
depends on your certification choice.

421
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,910
Did you choose CCNA?

422
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,630
Did you choose Network plus CCNA will
obviously take longer because it is

423
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,310
harder. I would estimate two to
four months to complete phase three,

424
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,520
leaning more on the four month
range. If we're talking about CNA,

425
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,960
this is a very aggressive timeline,
being very consistent with your study,

426
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,440
don't feel bad if you have to extend
this out. Just put a date in there,

427
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,610
be consistent. Show up every day. Now if
you get to phase three and you're done,

428
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,253
you're amazing.

429
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,520
You've laid the most incredible
IT foundation and from
here you can go anywhere,

430
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,860
pick any path. I believe you'll
succeed. You'll be a rock star.

431
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,400
But before you go anywhere else, before
you jump into a new learning path,

432
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,000
we've got just a little bitty phase to
make sure you're where you need to be.

433
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,440
And that's phase 3.5. What? Yeah,
no track. Track with me here.

434
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,680
We're going to come down
here and go to phase 3.5.

435
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,320
It looks so weird. 3.5 this
phase is called get that job.

436
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,600
If you don't have a job by this point,

437
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,340
then I want your full-time study to be
get a job because if you've gone through

438
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,750
phase one, two, and three,

439
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,230
you've got more than enough to land
a job and don't beat yourself down.

440
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,800
If you haven't gotten a job yet, that's
fine. I just wouldn't go any further.

441
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,120
I would pour all of your efforts
into doing this. So keep learning,

442
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,920
keep building up your skillset.

443
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,060
Keep sharpening the skills you've
learned and keep adding to your home lab.

444
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,360
Keep doing labs and projects.
Keep adding to your resume.

445
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,770
Keep applying for jobs, keep going to
interviews, practice, keep networking.

446
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,380
The whole point of all of this
is to get you a job and frankly,

447
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,980
when you're at the point of phase
3.5, you can apply for many,

448
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,920
many types of jobs. The
CNA, you look really good.

449
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,790
And if you've got the security plus and
a plus and you've got Python and Linux

450
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,880
and you've been adding to your resume
with projects, you look really good,

451
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,370
entry-level beginner
and intermediate jobs,

452
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,360
you can apply for those and you're
competitive. Now after phase 3.5,

453
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,280
pick your path. There are a billion.

454
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,730
Hopefully by this time you've kind of
figured out what you like or what you want

455
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,560
to be. You may have fallen
in love with security.

456
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,170
Maybe networking was your
calling system. Administration.

457
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,310
You learn some things about cloud
and cloud sounds awesome. Go do that.

458
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,790
These are all different paths that'll
have different requirements and alas,

459
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,030
I cannot cover them all. Did I just
say alas? I did. I'm going with it.

460
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,450
But if you do want me to cover others,
let me know in the comments below.

461
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,810
Right now I'm going to cover one path
that is special to me because I'm going

462
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,050
down it right now. And
that's the hacking path,

463
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,830
specifically offensive security
or otherwise known as red teaming.

464
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,040
Ethical hacking pen
testing. It has many names.

465
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,830
It's the flashy stuff you always
hear about. It is very cool.

466
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,100
It's not the only path in
cybersecurity, it's just one of many,

467
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,350
but it's the most popular.
You hear about learning.

468
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,230
Hacking is a whole journey in and
of itself. But to get started,

469
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,480
which is I'm going to be able to
show you, it would take forever.

470
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,280
I would target a cert, no surprise here.
And actually three different certs.

471
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,230
I would start out with
a junior level cert.

472
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,850
A couple I love are the EJPT or
the pen test Plus, they're easier,

473
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,870
more approachable,

474
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,540
and it'll dip your toe into what
it means to be an ethical hacker,

475
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,090
which is a different mindset.
Like yes, to be a hacker,

476
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,700
you have to know phase
one, two, and three.

477
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,540
All the skills you learn in those
phases will be used the opposite way.

478
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,360
Normally you're learning how to
build it, protect it, defend it.

479
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,650
Now you're having to reverse that
thinking and go, Hey, how can I break it?

480
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,480
The EJPT will be $249 including training
for three months through INE because

481
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,600
they run and operate the EJPT. And
I believe you get two attempts,

482
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,400
which is kind of awesome.

483
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,770
And if I had to choose between
the PEN Test Plus and EJPT,

484
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,490
I'd probably choose the EJPT.
The PEN test plus will be $381,

485
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,560
not including training, but
it is a bit more well known.

486
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,860
So if you're looking to put something
on your resume, that will look good.

487
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,650
Now I'm going to say this.
There's only one hacking, sir,

488
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,100
I'm going to list here that will
actually look good on your resume.

489
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,820
That will actually make people go, oh,
they know what they're talking about.

490
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,960
Or at least they're starting to.

491
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,520
The next one I would get the next phase
of your journey would be the CPTS or the

492
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,340
Certified Penetration Testing
Specialist from Hack the Box.

493
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,110
This is the one I'm working on right now.

494
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,620
The CPTS is interesting because you
do have to go through the Hack the Box

495
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,620
Academy modules to complete it. That's
what they tell you. I feel like.

496
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,410
What is Hack the Box? Oh, if
you want to become a hacker,

497
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,850
this is the place you want to be.

498
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,130
Before they have their academy
and their own certification,

499
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,590
they were the place to
go to practice hacking.

500
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,980
They would create boxes that you can
literally hack. It's very gamified,

501
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,730
very fun.

502
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,630
So when they created their own academy
and then a certification to go along with

503
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,450
it, oh, I'm down. I've been
a fan for a very long time.

504
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,480
I was trying to find the
pricing therapist. $490.

505
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,850
I don't think that includes
training. Lemme just find out.

506
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,030
I think that's just for the
voucher. Now the CPTS is fairly new,

507
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,850
so it's not quite resume
gold, not like the next one,

508
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,820
which is probably the best hacking
certification you can put on your resume,

509
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,180
and that's the OSCP. Now, the
OSCP is on my list to get,

510
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,170
but I'm going with the CPTS first because
it's a bit easier and I want to ease

511
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:01,190
my way up to it. But for a long time,
the OSEP has been the gold standard.

512
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,310
They do have their own official
training course called the Pen 200,

513
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,760
and they have an exam bundle
that'll cost you roughly 1600 bucks.

514
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,780
But that includes the course 90 days
of lab access in one exam attempt,

515
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,410
which is extremely practical
along with the CPTS and EJBT.

516
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,820
But I think the OSEP is probably the most
practical, if not the most difficult.

517
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,870
Now at this phase,

518
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,860
you're going to be using lots of
Linux and potentially lots of Python.

519
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,440
As you're going through
these hacking certifications,

520
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,900
you'll probably need a lot of
these to be able to take the exam.

521
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,010
What's interesting though is the OSCP
has recently allowed you to use Chad GPT

522
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,890
during the exam recognizing
the fact that hey,

523
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,700
modern engineers and modern hackers
are going to have AI right there.

524
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,430
Now this is just the very
beginning of a red teaming journey.

525
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,160
Will this be enough to get you a
job as a pin tester? I think so.

526
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,820
Similar to the other phases, start
applying immediately for what you want.

527
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,800
Don't wait to get your
first hacking certification.

528
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,500
Just start applying and while
you're applying, keep studying.

529
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,130
Now one note about this particular
phase, the hacking phase.

530
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,630
If you're confident you
want to go down that,

531
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,280
then I would also try to sprinkle in some
more hacking CTFs or capture the flag

532
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,990
events throughout your learning journey.

533
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,260
There's an amazing free CTF
software out there called PICO ctf.

534
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,880
Very beginner friendly and you can
interject that at any phase doing CTFs and

535
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,540
labs that are pertinent to the phase
you're at so you don't get overwhelmed.

536
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,710
It could be part of your Linux learning,

537
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,010
your Python learning and will give
you a feel for what A CTF feels like,

538
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,270
which if you're in the hacking realm,

539
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,360
CTFs are how people practice
their hacking skills.

540
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,650
It's a gamified attempt to hack something
to capture a flag that's hidden behind

541
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,730
security measures. But
there is a vulnerability you
have to exploit. Exploit.

542
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,420
It's kind of funny.

543
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,180
It's one of those words where you have
to put emphasis on whether or not it's

544
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,660
going to be a verb or a noun.
It's weird. So here we are,

545
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,250
the map phases one through
three, that's for everyone.

546
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,750
Everyone in it will benefit from going
through these phases and at every step be

547
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,540
applying for a job, never wait
to start earning experience.

548
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,270
But now we're at the section where we're
going to talk about shortcuts because

549
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,600
not everyone's going to follow this
roadmap sequentially, linearly.

550
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,830
I mean initially you'll want to follow
it just so because as a beginner you

551
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,490
probably don't know much, but you may
not be a beginner. So this roadmap,

552
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,540
tailor it to you,

553
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,270
make sure you have a good handle
on the basics and the foundations.

554
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,840
But there are points where you
could skip a phase. Like phase one,

555
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,000
you might already know all this stuff.

556
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,690
You've been playing with Linux and
Python, you know how to build a pc.

557
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,130
You've already got a home lab.

558
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,770
Just start applying for jobs
and move on to another phase.

559
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,510
Maybe you feel like you
already know enough security,

560
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,360
you don't need a certification, just
skip ahead, jump into networking.

561
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,630
Just keep in mind these certifications
are there to make your resume look

562
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,340
better. You don't need
it to gain the knowledge,

563
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,070
but you do need it to prove
the knowledge in most cases.

564
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,190
But it's up to you whether or not you
want to skip any phase. Just know that.

565
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,270
Let's say you skip phases one and two and
you just go straight to CC NA when you

566
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,170
get your CCC NA. No one cares if you
have your A plus or your network.

567
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,790
Plus all they see is the CCC NA and they
assume that everything else or at least

568
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,730
have passing knowledge. Also, keep
in mind that when you get a job,

569
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:58,440
which again is the goal of every
single step when you get a job that may

570
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,540
change this roadmap for you. For example,

571
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,000
you may apply for a job that
you think you'll never get,

572
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,930
like a SOC analyst job or a job in a
knock and you're able to skip the help

573
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,380
desk. And when you land that job,
they may want you to learn something.

574
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,260
They may want you to jump
straight to the CNA cyber ops,

575
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,350
which is a certification we didn't talk
about because it is more specialist to

576
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,210
blue Team Cybersecurity.

577
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,590
But my point is that just change
adapt to your circumstances and the

578
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,970
opportunities that are presented to you.

579
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,310
Don't feel like you have
to follow this just so,

580
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,190
and when you get a chance to
take a shortcut, take it now,

581
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,640
I don't mean a shortcut to knowledge,
always spend the time to learn something,

582
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,360
but if you can jump into a job you're
not ready for and they just hired you,

583
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,420
do that, that's awesome.
You can learn on the job.

584
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,630
That's what most people do anyway.
Now, what about college, university?

585
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,890
I didn't mention any of this here. Are
degrees worth it? Yes, they can be.

586
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,630
I didn't feature that on my
roadmap because I'm a big
fan of doing it this way.

587
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,080
I don't have a degree. I didn't need
one. But you might need one or want one,

588
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,770
and that's totally fine. It will
be valuable and it will open doors.

589
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,250
It might be a very time consuming and
expensive door, but it'll get you there.

590
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,250
But keep this in mind. If
you're going for an IT degree,

591
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,620
many of these degrees when you finish,

592
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,680
you're still going to need what's
covered in these certifications.

593
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,320
They don't often include that in
your curriculum. When you come out,

594
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,950
you're going to be like, oh, I still
need to get my CCNA and my security plus.

595
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,770
No one's going to hire me
without those. That's happens.

596
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,620
That happens all the time. So my
advice, if you want that degree,

597
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,180
find a degree program that includes
certifications as part of your curriculum.

598
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,720
So for example, one I love is WGU or
the Western Governor's University.

599
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,850
Part of many of their IT
degrees is C-C-N-A-A plus AWS

600
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,840
certifications for cloud.

601
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,170
It's like part of their final exam
for the networking section of classes.

602
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,400
You have to pass your
certification. That's amazing.

603
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,700
You get a degree and you
get certifications, you
come out a rockstar. Yes,

604
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,860
it will be more expensive
than just doing this yourself,

605
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,620
but if you want a degree,
that's what I recommend.

606
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,860
Alright, so network.
Chuck sent me his roadmap,

607
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,810
a little 2025 plan to get a job in it.
Maybe a little bit of cybersecurity.

608
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,860
So I did want to take a quick look
starting off. He's saying, look,

609
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,210
you should be studying Linux and Python
early in the journey and then keep doing

610
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,980
it all the way throughout.
Not going to lie,

611
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,010
I completely a thousand
percent agree with this.

612
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,290
Maybe it doesn't need
to be strictly Python,

613
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:19,180
but absolutely I feel like using the
Linux command line and at least scripting

614
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,120
in a language like Python or
writing code or programming,

615
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,100
automating in one way or another,

616
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,130
that is something that
should really be solidified.

617
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,720
And so definitely worth starting as
early as you can and still doing it all

618
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,830
throughout. Those are skills that give
you superpowers, not going to lie.

619
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,930
And then Chuck goes into a lot about
networking net plus versus CCC NA or

620
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,150
if it is needed at all. So look, again,

621
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,370
I have to speak from just
me and my experience.

622
00:30:47,205 --> 00:30:52,090
I don't know what CCC NA
GOs darn is, truth be told.

623
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,300
Maybe I'm out of the loop. I could
very well just not be educated there,

624
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,990
but I have not particularly
needed a ton of in-depth,

625
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,110
very granular networking
insight and experience.

626
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,040
I think from the hacking or
cybersecurity sense, if you know, hey,

627
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,180
what the heck IP addresses are, what
a general cider, class C, class B,

628
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,940
whatever network and subnets
are, that's kind of enough.

629
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,800
You don't need to be building out any
VLANs or crafting and architecting a

630
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,460
whole blown network. Next
is on the hacking path.

631
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,800
Some of the certifications with EJPT,

632
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,590
PENTEST plus maybe CPTS and OSCP.

633
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:32,230
This is just John speaking. I
don't know about EJPT these days.

634
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,850
I don't know if it's alive and well,

635
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,680
but I might very well
just be out of the loop.

636
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,680
And I have not personally
taken PENTEST Plus,

637
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,800
so I don't feel like I have any authority
to kind of speak on that as much.

638
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,620
I do think either of them
are a good choice though.

639
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,820
Pentest plus especially might give you
a little bit more runway because any of

640
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,510
the plus CompTIA certifications
are just generally well-known.

641
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,980
But I would consider OSCP still
the crown jewel I'd suggest look,

642
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,180
if that's what you want to go for it,
if you want some intermediary steps,

643
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,620
CPTS or any others that you're interested
in can still be stepping stones.

644
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,000
But make sure you've got,

645
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,590
this is your target in mind and don't
hesitate drive towards that. Ooh,

646
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,540
the last one is spicy. His
view on college, look, college,

647
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,400
undergrad, school, university,
whatever. I kind of agree with Chuck.

648
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,640
Not going to lie, I think it is optional.

649
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,270
It is not needed in the absolute
strict sense of the words,

650
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:32,770
but it can be extremely helpful
to go through. It's subjective.

651
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,940
It's super subjective to you and your
case for anyone tuning in. You can crawl,

652
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,360
walk,

653
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,320
and run just fine without a college degree
or anything to kind of get your foot

654
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,110
in the door for job hunting.
You can find places,

655
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,220
occupations and people that will employ
you without a college degree if you

656
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,080
prove your merit and competency. But
it is an extra notch on your belt.

657
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,590
So there's nothing really wrong with
that. As I mentioned, crawl, walk, run.

658
00:32:57,665 --> 00:33:01,100
Hey, you can get a little bit of a
speed boost if you go for college.

659
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,790
Maybe that helps get things up and
running at the start, but it's optional.

660
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,930
College can be good, but I don't
think you need it a thousand percent.

661
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,180
So lemme end cap this. It's
been a very long video,

662
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,750
but times have changed and times
are changing rapidly right now.

663
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,320
What's going to happen with ai? Where
are our jobs going to go? I don't know.

664
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,990
No one knows. We can all guess.

665
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:26,120
But what we do know is that
you need skills. The skills
covered in this roadmap,

666
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,200
foundational skills,

667
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,860
and people still hire for those skills
and I think they'll be in demand for a

668
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,085
long time. And if they aren't,
hey, you'll learn something anyway.

669
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,820
And I know this roadmap ended up
being very specific to hacking.

670
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,600
What other roadmaps do you want to
see? Cloud engineer, network engineer,

671
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,940
more blue team, comment
below. That's all I got.

672
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,790
This is the first video of
2025. I hope you're doing well.

673
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,410
I'll catch you guys next time.
