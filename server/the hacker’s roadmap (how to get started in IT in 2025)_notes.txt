# the hackerâ€™s roadmap (how to get started in IT in 2025)

## Summary

- Here is the roadmap to get started in it in 2025, and it's been two years since I've made a video on this.

- Some things have changed, but first let's talk about what hasn't changed. This roadmap is aimed at getting you a job in it fast and on the path to landing

- your dream job. Six figures is absolutely within reach and you'll be surprised at how fast you can get there. No gimmicks. No shortcuts,

- just hard work on a clear path and also no college. You don't need it. Now, similar to our last roadmap, the first three phases are for you.

- They're for everyone. The skills you learn here are foundational to it no matter what path you go down, but after that,

- the world is your oyster. What I mean is that you can go down many different paths. I can't cover them all here,

- but I will be talking about one of the most exciting ones, the coolest ones, the ones you see on tv. Cybersecurity specifically. How do you become a hacker?

- Ethically, of course, and also, please know this may be a roadmap, but you don't necessarily have to drive all the way down in the same order.

- In fact, you may find a shortcut. We'll talk more about that later. And just so you know, this roadmap is hacker approved.

- John Hammond looked at it and said, yes. This is John Hammond approved. So here we go. Phase one. Actually, no, no Phase zero. Yeah,

- we're doing things different this year and this might feel weird for phase zero. I want you to start applying for jobs right now.

- I don't care that you know nothing. That's okay. I get it. It feels a bit cart before horse, but lemme tell you,

- you don't need IT skills to get that first job in it. Now I know many of these entry-level IT help desk jobs.

- It seems like they're asking for a lot. Look at this one, a help desk specialist in Houston, Texas. They want you to have a year experience.

- They want you to have some strong technical skills already, but really all they care about is excellent customer

- service skills. Trust me. Alright, come here. Can I tell you a secret? I got my first IT job without a

- certification to my name or really any IT skills, but I did have some fast food job experience and I

- was hungry not for fast food but for IT, for learning and proving that I could be of value to that company. Now,

- the reason I want you to apply for IT help desk or technical support roles is that it's the first job for most people in it. It's entry level.

- Can you skip it? It's possible. In fact, I encourage you to apply for jobs above that. It's not going to hurt anything and you

- never know, but if you're fresh green, just getting started, help desk is an amazing place to be. You'll learn so much and you're not going

- to be there for very long unless you want to be. Help desk is pretty fun. At that point, it was the best job I ever had.

- I actually had fun going to work and I really didn't want to leave. So right now, if you want to get started in it,

- polish up that resume for what you want to do, not what you have done. Tailor your experience to be very IT focused. For example,

- I worked at Starbucks, but you better believe on that resume I put on there, I fix their printer all the time. I was the guy they would go to Chuck,

- the printer's broken again. I got you guys also on my resume. I was very upfront about what I was working towards, what I was studying.

- We'll talk about that here in a moment and if you want examples of what that might look like, I do have a video where I broke down

- some really awesome resumes and reviewed some LinkedIn profiles. Check those out here somewhere. The holdup. Why are we doing this?

- Why are we getting a job immediately before we learn anything? This reason, experience is king. It's gold. Nothing looks better on your

- resume than experience. Also, what you learn on that job will be more valuable than anything else you study. So phase zero,

- polish up that resume and make your LinkedIn profile look awesome. Start applying for jobs right now, right after this video. Seriously,

- it'll take you a couple hours and maintain a habit of regularly applying for jobs until you get that job. And guess what? It's okay if you don't get it.

- It's okay if you go on an interview and you fail. You're learning so much in this process and you're meeting people also just

- going through all these different jobs and seeing the descriptions and what they're looking for will teach you a lot. And also kind of a footnote,

- one more thing you want to do is start networking the social kind, acquaint yourself with the IT world. Start following people on Twitter and

- get into Discord and start talking to people who are like you, who are studying. Start talking to people who are above you, who are mentors.

- The old adage is true. It's not what it's who. Most of the jobs I've gotten have been through relationships that I've built.

- I know phase zero is weird. Might feel like a waste of time right now because all you want to do is learn it because it's awesome. Don't

- skip this if you're serious. So if you're in a place right now to where you can get a job and start working in it, if that's really what you want

- to do, phase zero, man, say it with me. Phase zero. Sorry, phase one now I don't want you to move on until you've applied for at least two

- jobs. Also, leave a comment below if you get a job. Oh, I'd be so excited to hear that and how encouraging will that be for other

- people? Just do that. Now, phase one compared to my last video in 2023, it's changed a little bit, but it's still going to be

- about foundations developing those core IT skills. Now I'm a big believer in IT certifications and

- what they can do for your career. You'll see many of these on the roadmap. The first one I recommend for

- foundations is the compt A plus. This essentially is the help desk certification that's going to help you land

- that first job. Can you skip it? We'll talk about that here in a second, but here's what you're going to learn and actually there's a new one they just

- came out with launching Spring 2025 exciting. But the A plus is an IT buffet. They're going to teach you so many things, which is great because when

- you first get started in it, you may not know which path you want to go down and there are a billion paths. The a plus gives you a

- chance to sample everything. Programming may be a bit dry, but networking is delicious and you'll never know until you try it.

- Now for most people, getting the A plus certification is not easy. It's a lot of information contained in two exams each costing you $253 and yes,

- that's per exam and that's for the current exams. I'm not sure what the 2025 exams will cost. We'll see.

- Now I know for someone just starting out, this is a lot and that was the case for me. I even failed one exam and had to

- retake it paying more money. That hurt. So it begs the question, is this worth it? Do you actually need the exam? Can't you just go study the knowledge,

- learn it, save some money? Yeah, you can, but here's the problem. How are you going to prove that knowledge? How are you going to prove

- that to the hiring manager? That's what the a plus is for. Compt has done all the marketing for you. They tell people, Hey, if someone has

- this cert, they know everything. So hr, all they have to do is go, oh, Aaron has the a plus. He can probably do this help desk job.

- It gets you past that HR filter. So TLDR, you need the knowledge certification. It's optional, but it'll help you get that foot in

- the door and land that first job. Now how do you get the A plus? Where do you learn this stuff from? There are free and paid options for

- free. You can't beat Professor Messer. He has an entire A plus course on YouTube. You can watch it right now. Now for a paid option, there's IT

- Pro tv, which I love. Link below. Actually now it's called IT Pro and also this will be a shameless plug for me. I'm building something which

- means it's not done yet, but it's going to be kind of different. You'll see. Just keep in mind, it is still in the building phase and

- part of this new thing, my academy, there'll be an entire CompTIA a plus course, a training series that I'm pouring

- my blood, sweat, and coffee into. It's something that I wish would've been around when I first started my IT career and started learning.

- So if you like to start studying this as we're building it, check it out. Link below. It's currently 12 bucks a month and

- every penny is going towards making this thing awesome. And yes, I will be covering the 2025 compt a plus exams. Now the goal with phase one is to get

- your a plus or at least equivalent knowledge, but we're not quite done yet. This is where my roadmap's going to start being a little weird compared to 2023,

- and by weird I mean awesome. Now this is optional because I don't want you to be overwhelmed, but while you're studying for your A plus,

- I want you to start learning Linux and not just Linux. I want you to start learning coding as well,

- specifically either Python or go Python's the favorite. So I go with that Python, I don't want to be confusing. Now again,

- getting the A plus is still your main focus, but I want you to start becoming familiar with Linux and Python.

- Now what does that look like? How are you going to do that? Start simple. Maybe one day a week. Saturdays you'll spend 30 minutes

- learning Linux and 30 minutes learning Python or an hour each, two hours each. I don't really care what you do as long as you do something.

- Now where do you learn? What are the resources? There are a bajillion out there for Linux. I have a free Linux for Hackers course.

- You could watch one episode a week for Python. I have a Python for everyone. Course these are both free on YouTube by the way. Now why Linux and coding?

- Well, you're going to see this everywhere at every step of your journey, start learning it now again, even if it's just a little bit.

- Now we're not done with phase one yet. You thought we were. We're not also in phase one. I want you to start building out your home lab.

- This is where you get a chance to put into practice everything you're learning. Don't just learn the theory, take notes and memorize things. No,

- do the things. For example, when you're learning about virtual machines in the a plus in your home lab, install virtual box and

- set up a virtual machine. Install Ubuntu as part of your Linux practice. When you're learning about networks,

- install a router in your house. Replace your home router with PF sense. Install a DNS server. Most if not all of these things can be

- done for free and it's going to be this. Check this out. I call these projects resume building moments because you know what else you're

- going to be doing in phase one. You're going to be applying for jobs if you don't already have one. Keep applying. Keep refining your resume.

- When you deploy a DNS server into your home, put on your resume a project that you deployed a DNS server into your house.

- That's cool. That's real tech, that's real it lemme tell you, if you have a home lab, you look good. That communicates passion and drive.

- Man. When I saw resumes or people were putting their own projects in their house on their resume,

- I love hiring those types of people that they are passionate about this. Even when they go home, I know they're going to be thinking about

- this stuff and learning and growing. That's what employers want and that's surprisingly hard to hire for. So if you can demonstrate that,

- oh my gosh. Now I know phase one, that's a luck, right? Feel free to cut some things out. If all you can manage is the a

- plus during this time, that's fine. You can do these in order. Finish your A plus the Newsome, Lins and Python, implement some home lab ideas.

- It's up to you where you can do it all within one week. Now to fully graduate from phase one, I'm estimating it'll take you

- roughly two to three months. Of course this will vary based on your life, your schedule, how much time you have, but if

- you work hard, you can do it, but two to three months if you maintain a pretty consistent study schedule should be good. Now on to phase two. Yes,

- we're finally moving on to phase two. I know phase two is all about dipping your toes in the security water. It's kind of a cool brand name dibs.

- The focal point of this phase is gaining the security plus from CompTIA. Yes, another IT certification, but this thing looks really,

- really good on your resume, similar to the A plus, the security plus will teach you a ton of information,

- but here it's security focused. They might be thinking, Chuck, I'm not going into hacking. I don't want to be a security expert.

- Why do I have to learn this? Listen, security will be part of every IT role you have. The more you know about it, the better. And for phase two, we're

- not going super deep into security, but we're giving you enough knowledge and enough credentials to find in land an amazing job. Now, why security

- plus why another certification? This looker is going to do two things for you. Knowledge, there's a ton of it. This is a security buffet

- and similar to the a plus, you're going to find out about roles and paths, but just cybersecurity that you

- didn't know existed. It's a big world. Number two, this is definitely a checkbox cert. What does that mean? A lot of companies want

- you to have this. In fact, this is one of the most popular certs for people who want to work for the government in any capacity because

- it satisfies the DOD 85 70 directive, which lays out the minimum requirements for IT and cybersecurity roles. The security plus is the

- easiest way to check that box. You'll find that most roles just want you to have it by default. Currently the security plus will cost

- you $404 and that's just one exam. And again, yes, you can learn the knowledge within the security plus without getting the

- certification, but the certification looks really good on your resume. Now where can you study for the security? Plus again, free and paid options,

- free Professor master coming in, he has an entire security plus course for free on YouTube for a paid option. I do recommend it Pro and know

- they're not sponsoring this video. I just really do like them. And full disclosure, the link below will be an affiliate link,

- meaning that when you sign up you don't pay anymore, but I do get a small kickback for telling you about 'em.

- Now while the focal point of phase two is security, plus there's going to be more Linux. Linux becomes very,

- very important in this phase. And because we're in the security phase, let's have you do some Linux that's security focused.

- There's a free site called Over the wire. This place is amazing and they have a path called Bandit, which when you go through it will teach

- you a ton of Linux basics. It's amazing, very, very fun. Check it out. Also in this phase, no surprise is more coding Python at

- this phase, keep learning the basics, but then I want you to challenge yourself to build some kind of thing, a project. Think something that

- you could add to your resume. Another resume building moment. One idea is to build a simple network scanner, scan your network and look for

- open ports using Python. And again, similar to phase one, don't stress about the Python and Linux side of things. Focus on security plus get that

- on your resume. But if can, if it doesn't overwhelm you, one to two hours a week more. If you're crazy, the more Linux and Python you learn,

- the better It's going to be awesome for you. And at this point I'm going to start sounding like a broken record.

- Do some home lab stuff, what you're learning in the security plus what you're learning through Linux and Python. Do some things in your home lab.

- Automate some things with Linux and Python. Get on YouTube and look for fun projects. I do all kinds of stuff in the home lab.

- Just do something and add it to your resume. And finally, keep applying for stinking jobs if you don't already have one.

- And always keep that resume up to date. This space should roughly take you two to three months and I know what you're probably thinking. I would be

- thinking the same thing. Chuck, you're being very vague about how much Linux and Python to learn. How much do I do in my home

- lab? I'm doing that on purpose. I don't want to overwhelm you also, that would make this video way too long. But if you'd like me to make a more

- detailed roadmap where I'm like at this point do this project, at this point you should know this much Python. If you'd like to see that, let me know.

- That may be a video I make in the future. So phase two, two to three months, which of course will be determined by how much time you have and other

- variables. It's time for a coffee break and this coffee break in this video is sponsored by Bamboo Labs,

- which I'm actually really excited to talk about because I've been using Bamboo Labs forever. They're one of the first 3D printers I ever bought.

- And the reason I'm excited is because they're going to help you with your resume building moments, the chance for you to shine and show off your home labs.

- I got into 3D printing about maybe two, three years ago and I bought this 3D printer. I hated it. Took me forever to set up, almost pulled

- out my beard, thank goodness I didn't. And the printing was slow, so I'm like there's got to be something better. And that's when I found Bamboo

- Labs. I bought this one. I don't think I worked for two weeks. I would just stand there and watch things. Print Bamboo Labs is one of those ones

- that it's advanced enough to make you excited about diving deeper, but it's simple enough for anyone to approach it. Like someone in my church, he just

- bought a 3D printer for his kids. They set it up and just started printing everything. In fact, they bought this one here.

- The Bamboo Labs a one combo. This thing is ridiculous, super fast, easy to set up. My team can set it up and they're

- not the most technical people. They're working on it. And the deal on this thing at the time of this video, it's $489 for the printer

- and then this a MS light. What that means is that you can do multicolor prints, you can design your model,

- slice it with a bunch of colors and it'll just change it out for you. Now back to home lab stuff. You can make your home lab that much more great.

- Make your resume building moments a bit prettier, a bit more functional with a 3D printer. So when I did my travel mass video,

- I needed something that would house all my stuff, my SSDs and everything printed that sucker.

- And then me and my team 3D printed a few more things just to give you some ideas. This raspberry pie case, sure you can buy a case online,

- but making your own, printing your own, that's way cooler. It's SSD Mount for maybe whatever server you're going to be building,

- not as flashy but functional. This SD card holder, I've actually printed a few of these in the past.

- We legit use these every day and as you're building out your home lab, you'll probably end up having a rack. So you'll want to rack mount

- your raspberry pie, print that and check this out. They have this thing called Maker World. It's a world full of things you can print

- and what makes it special is that when you select one of these, you don't have to change any of the settings or alter it for your specific

- printer, which you used to have to do. No, you just select your printer and the settings are already there. So thanks again to Bamboo Labs

- for sponsoring this video. If you want this A one combo, check out my link below and now back to the roadmap.

- Now before we move on to phase three, just know that in phase one and phase two should also be continuing with networking, social networking, keep

- talking to people, keep rubbing shoulders. Again, you never know who is going to be responsible for getting you that next job,

- make friends, make contacts. Now speaking of networking, let's talk about phase three. It's all networking. My favorite part,

- networking is the bread and butter of it. You have to know it and when you get into it, you'll find out that you love to

- know it. Networking is the best part. I know it's completely subjective and I'm completely biased. Network, Chuck. I mean you saw it coming, right?

- But you don't want to skip this. It's like eating your vegetables, except these vegetables are delicious. Now with networking similar

- to our other phases, we're going to focus on a certification here. We actually have a couple of options.

- Now, if you saw my last video, there won't be a big surprise here. My favorite networking certification is the Cisco CNA.

- This sucker right here is probably one of the best certifications you can get and put on your resume period. This chumps 'em all at this level. Anyway,

- employers love this one. It's the gold standard, but there is another option I want to shout out. And that's the CompTIA Network.

- Plus it's another very, very popular networking certification. Now, why would you choose one over the other? Well, Cisco, it's harder.

- It's going to take you more time, take you more study, it might kick your butt a bit more. But the CNA is more valuable probably

- because it's harder and demonstrates practical skills. And one of the reasons it's so practical is because it's Cisco focused with the

- certification, you're going to learn networking inside and out, but you're also going to be learning how to use Cisco products, their CLI.

- You'll be learning about their automation products, their security products. So this is the no-brainer if you're going to go down the network engineering

- path or network admin path. But if you're going somewhere else, CNA might be a bit too much for you. That's where the Network plus comes in.

- It's vendor neutral so you're not focusing on any one vendor and you'll still pick up networking knowledge, learning what a router is, a switch subnetting,

- they'll both look great on your resume. CCNA will make you look better. Also, it will only help you to know how to use Cisco stuff because Cisco is

- everywhere. A ton of companies use them. They have been dominant for a long time. Let's talk about pricing. The Network plus will cost you $369.

- It is one exam and the CCNA will cost you $300. So it actually is the better deal even though it's harder. Now,

- where do you go to learn? Where can you learn this stuff for Network Plus, similar to the other CompTIA certifications,

- professor Messer co and Clutch has a free network plus course on YouTube for paid IT Pro has a pretty good network plus course. And then for the CC NA,

- I'm actually really excited to tell you about this. There is a and paid option free. There's a channel called Jeremy's,

- IT Labs on YouTube and he has an entire course CCNA for free, which is kind of insane because the CC NA is very, very hard to teach.

- It's a lot of content. And Jeremy's a friend of mine, he's an awesome dude. He also lives in Japan, which is very cool. After the paid option,

- this is what I'm excited about. I mentioned my academy earlier, my new thing, I'm building the thing that's

- going to be different. Well, I'm not building it alone and I don't think I've publicly announced this to anyone yet. So you're first to hear,

- I've partnered with a guy who taught me networking. That's where I learned everything. I know he's the guy who got me so excited

- about it and really he's responsible for what I'm doing today. His name is Jeremy Charra. He's A-C-C-I-E. Incredible teacher.

- He's where I learned how to teach and he has created the most amazing CCNA course, the best one he's ever made on our academy. So similar to the A plus,

- it is currently on the academy. We're still in our building phase, but you can go there right now and become part of this as we're building it.

- But please keep in mind disclaimer, it's not completely ready yet. We're building it, but I would love for you to come check

- it out and become part of what we're doing. It is going to be something different. That's all I can tell you now. So pick your poison CC A or Network Plus,

- and then you probably saw this coming more Python and more Linux. And in the networking phase, try to make your Linux and Python

- study be networking focused. A big part of the Cisco CC NA is network automation, which largely involves

- doing things with Python, logging into routers and switches and automating things they can do. It's very fun. Set aside two to three

- hours a week and just spend time with it. Continue to get familiar with the Linux terminal programming and Python and just let those skills compliment the main

- focus, which here is networking. Again, doing this is going to make you super human. You're going to be amazing. I mean you already are, but this

- will make you that much better. And of course in this phase we'll be doing more home. But here I want to give you a

- challenge. We mentioned in phase one, replacing your router with PF sense as an option. And this phase, I want to challenge you to actually

- do this. This is your homework. Replace your home network with another network. This could be buying old

- Cisco stuff off eBay. This could be putting a PF sense router in installing Unify. And then I want you to do things

- like monitor your network, monitor your internet quality, be really nerdy about it, and then all that stuff you're doing,

- slap that onto a resume and keep applying for jobs. And then of course, keep networking. Keep talking to people. Keep hanging out.

- Now how long this phase will take you depends on your certification choice. Did you choose CCNA? Did you choose Network plus CCNA will

- obviously take longer because it is harder. I would estimate two to four months to complete phase three, leaning more on the four month

- range. If we're talking about CNA, this is a very aggressive timeline, being very consistent with your study, don't feel bad if you have to extend

- this out. Just put a date in there, be consistent. Show up every day. Now if you get to phase three and you're done, you're amazing.

- You've laid the most incredible IT foundation and from here you can go anywhere, pick any path. I believe you'll

- succeed. You'll be a rock star. But before you go anywhere else, before you jump into a new learning path, we've got just a little bitty phase to

- make sure you're where you need to be. And that's phase 3.5. What? Yeah, no track. Track with me here. We're going to come down

- here and go to phase 3.5. It looks so weird. 3.5 this phase is called get that job. If you don't have a job by this point,

- then I want your full-time study to be get a job because if you've gone through phase one, two, and three, you've got more than enough to land

- a job and don't beat yourself down. If you haven't gotten a job yet, that's fine. I just wouldn't go any further. I would pour all of your efforts

- into doing this. So keep learning, keep building up your skillset. Keep sharpening the skills you've learned and keep adding to your home lab.

- Keep doing labs and projects. Keep adding to your resume. Keep applying for jobs, keep going to interviews, practice, keep networking.

- The whole point of all of this is to get you a job and frankly, when you're at the point of phase 3.5, you can apply for many,

- many types of jobs. The CNA, you look really good. And if you've got the security plus and a plus and you've got Python and Linux

- and you've been adding to your resume with projects, you look really good, entry-level beginner and intermediate jobs,

- you can apply for those and you're competitive. Now after phase 3.5, pick your path. There are a billion. Hopefully by this time you've kind of

- figured out what you like or what you want to be. You may have fallen in love with security. Maybe networking was your

- calling system. Administration. You learn some things about cloud and cloud sounds awesome. Go do that. These are all different paths that'll

- have different requirements and alas, I cannot cover them all. Did I just say alas? I did. I'm going with it. But if you do want me to cover others,

- let me know in the comments below. Right now I'm going to cover one path that is special to me because I'm going down it right now. And

- that's the hacking path, specifically offensive security or otherwise known as red teaming. Ethical hacking pen

- testing. It has many names. It's the flashy stuff you always hear about. It is very cool. It's not the only path in

- cybersecurity, it's just one of many, but it's the most popular. You hear about learning. Hacking is a whole journey in and

- of itself. But to get started, which is I'm going to be able to show you, it would take forever. I would target a cert, no surprise here.

- And actually three different certs. I would start out with a junior level cert. A couple I love are the EJPT or

- the pen test Plus, they're easier, more approachable, and it'll dip your toe into what it means to be an ethical hacker,

- which is a different mindset. Like yes, to be a hacker, you have to know phase one, two, and three.

- All the skills you learn in those phases will be used the opposite way. Normally you're learning how to build it, protect it, defend it.

- Now you're having to reverse that thinking and go, Hey, how can I break it? The EJPT will be $249 including training for three months through INE because

- they run and operate the EJPT. And I believe you get two attempts, which is kind of awesome. And if I had to choose between

- the PEN Test Plus and EJPT, I'd probably choose the EJPT. The PEN test plus will be $381, not including training, but

- it is a bit more well known. So if you're looking to put something on your resume, that will look good. Now I'm going to say this.

- There's only one hacking, sir, I'm going to list here that will actually look good on your resume. That will actually make people go, oh,

- they know what they're talking about. Or at least they're starting to. The next one I would get the next phase of your journey would be the CPTS or the

- Certified Penetration Testing Specialist from Hack the Box. This is the one I'm working on right now. The CPTS is interesting because you

- do have to go through the Hack the Box Academy modules to complete it. That's what they tell you. I feel like. What is Hack the Box? Oh, if

- you want to become a hacker, this is the place you want to be. Before they have their academy and their own certification,

- they were the place to go to practice hacking. They would create boxes that you can literally hack. It's very gamified,

- very fun. So when they created their own academy and then a certification to go along with it, oh, I'm down. I've been

- a fan for a very long time. I was trying to find the pricing therapist. $490. I don't think that includes

- training. Lemme just find out. I think that's just for the voucher. Now the CPTS is fairly new, so it's not quite resume

- gold, not like the next one, which is probably the best hacking certification you can put on your resume, and that's the OSCP. Now, the

- OSCP is on my list to get, but I'm going with the CPTS first because it's a bit easier and I want to ease my way up to it. But for a long time,

- the OSEP has been the gold standard. They do have their own official training course called the Pen 200, and they have an exam bundle

- that'll cost you roughly 1600 bucks. But that includes the course 90 days of lab access in one exam attempt, which is extremely practical

- along with the CPTS and EJBT. But I think the OSEP is probably the most practical, if not the most difficult. Now at this phase,

- you're going to be using lots of Linux and potentially lots of Python. As you're going through these hacking certifications,

- you'll probably need a lot of these to be able to take the exam. What's interesting though is the OSCP has recently allowed you to use Chad GPT

- during the exam recognizing the fact that hey, modern engineers and modern hackers are going to have AI right there.

- Now this is just the very beginning of a red teaming journey. Will this be enough to get you a job as a pin tester? I think so.

- Similar to the other phases, start applying immediately for what you want. Don't wait to get your first hacking certification.

- Just start applying and while you're applying, keep studying. Now one note about this particular phase, the hacking phase.

- If you're confident you want to go down that, then I would also try to sprinkle in some more hacking CTFs or capture the flag

- events throughout your learning journey. There's an amazing free CTF software out there called PICO ctf. Very beginner friendly and you can

- interject that at any phase doing CTFs and labs that are pertinent to the phase you're at so you don't get overwhelmed. It could be part of your Linux learning,

- your Python learning and will give you a feel for what A CTF feels like, which if you're in the hacking realm, CTFs are how people practice

- their hacking skills. It's a gamified attempt to hack something to capture a flag that's hidden behind security measures. But

- there is a vulnerability you have to exploit. Exploit. It's kind of funny. It's one of those words where you have

- to put emphasis on whether or not it's going to be a verb or a noun. It's weird. So here we are, the map phases one through

- three, that's for everyone. Everyone in it will benefit from going through these phases and at every step be applying for a job, never wait

- to start earning experience. But now we're at the section where we're going to talk about shortcuts because not everyone's going to follow this

- roadmap sequentially, linearly. I mean initially you'll want to follow it just so because as a beginner you probably don't know much, but you may

- not be a beginner. So this roadmap, tailor it to you, make sure you have a good handle on the basics and the foundations.

- But there are points where you could skip a phase. Like phase one, you might already know all this stuff. You've been playing with Linux and

- Python, you know how to build a pc. You've already got a home lab. Just start applying for jobs and move on to another phase.

- Maybe you feel like you already know enough security, you don't need a certification, just skip ahead, jump into networking.

- Just keep in mind these certifications are there to make your resume look better. You don't need it to gain the knowledge,

- but you do need it to prove the knowledge in most cases. But it's up to you whether or not you want to skip any phase. Just know that.

- Let's say you skip phases one and two and you just go straight to CC NA when you get your CCC NA. No one cares if you have your A plus or your network.

- Plus all they see is the CCC NA and they assume that everything else or at least have passing knowledge. Also, keep in mind that when you get a job,

- which again is the goal of every single step when you get a job that may change this roadmap for you. For example, you may apply for a job that

- you think you'll never get, like a SOC analyst job or a job in a knock and you're able to skip the help desk. And when you land that job,

- they may want you to learn something. They may want you to jump straight to the CNA cyber ops, which is a certification we didn't talk

- about because it is more specialist to blue Team Cybersecurity. But my point is that just change adapt to your circumstances and the

- opportunities that are presented to you. Don't feel like you have to follow this just so, and when you get a chance to

- take a shortcut, take it now, I don't mean a shortcut to knowledge, always spend the time to learn something, but if you can jump into a job you're

- not ready for and they just hired you, do that, that's awesome. You can learn on the job. That's what most people do anyway.

- Now, what about college, university? I didn't mention any of this here. Are degrees worth it? Yes, they can be. I didn't feature that on my

- roadmap because I'm a big fan of doing it this way. I don't have a degree. I didn't need one. But you might need one or want one,

- and that's totally fine. It will be valuable and it will open doors. It might be a very time consuming and expensive door, but it'll get you there.

- But keep this in mind. If you're going for an IT degree, many of these degrees when you finish, you're still going to need what's

- covered in these certifications. They don't often include that in your curriculum. When you come out, you're going to be like, oh, I still

- need to get my CCNA and my security plus. No one's going to hire me without those. That's happens. That happens all the time. So my

- advice, if you want that degree, find a degree program that includes certifications as part of your curriculum. So for example, one I love is WGU or

- the Western Governor's University. Part of many of their IT degrees is C-C-N-A-A plus AWS certifications for cloud.

- It's like part of their final exam for the networking section of classes. You have to pass your certification. That's amazing.

- You get a degree and you get certifications, you come out a rockstar. Yes, it will be more expensive

- than just doing this yourself, but if you want a degree, that's what I recommend. Alright, so network.

- Chuck sent me his roadmap, a little 2025 plan to get a job in it. Maybe a little bit of cybersecurity. So I did want to take a quick look

- starting off. He's saying, look, you should be studying Linux and Python early in the journey and then keep doing it all the way throughout.

- Not going to lie, I completely a thousand percent agree with this. Maybe it doesn't need

- to be strictly Python, but absolutely I feel like using the Linux command line and at least scripting in a language like Python or

- writing code or programming, automating in one way or another, that is something that should really be solidified.

- And so definitely worth starting as early as you can and still doing it all throughout. Those are skills that give you superpowers, not going to lie.

- And then Chuck goes into a lot about networking net plus versus CCC NA or if it is needed at all. So look, again, I have to speak from just

- me and my experience. I don't know what CCC NA GOs darn is, truth be told. Maybe I'm out of the loop. I could

- very well just not be educated there, but I have not particularly needed a ton of in-depth, very granular networking

- insight and experience. I think from the hacking or cybersecurity sense, if you know, hey, what the heck IP addresses are, what

- a general cider, class C, class B, whatever network and subnets are, that's kind of enough. You don't need to be building out any

- VLANs or crafting and architecting a whole blown network. Next is on the hacking path. Some of the certifications with EJPT,

- PENTEST plus maybe CPTS and OSCP. This is just John speaking. I don't know about EJPT these days. I don't know if it's alive and well,

- but I might very well just be out of the loop. And I have not personally taken PENTEST Plus,

- so I don't feel like I have any authority to kind of speak on that as much. I do think either of them are a good choice though.

- Pentest plus especially might give you a little bit more runway because any of the plus CompTIA certifications are just generally well-known.

- But I would consider OSCP still the crown jewel I'd suggest look, if that's what you want to go for it, if you want some intermediary steps,

- CPTS or any others that you're interested in can still be stepping stones. But make sure you've got, this is your target in mind and don't

- hesitate drive towards that. Ooh, the last one is spicy. His view on college, look, college, undergrad, school, university,

- whatever. I kind of agree with Chuck. Not going to lie, I think it is optional. It is not needed in the absolute strict sense of the words,

- but it can be extremely helpful to go through. It's subjective. It's super subjective to you and your case for anyone tuning in. You can crawl,

- walk, and run just fine without a college degree or anything to kind of get your foot in the door for job hunting.

- You can find places, occupations and people that will employ you without a college degree if you prove your merit and competency. But

- it is an extra notch on your belt. So there's nothing really wrong with that. As I mentioned, crawl, walk, run. Hey, you can get a little bit of a

- speed boost if you go for college. Maybe that helps get things up and running at the start, but it's optional. College can be good, but I don't

- think you need it a thousand percent. So lemme end cap this. It's been a very long video, but times have changed and times

- are changing rapidly right now. What's going to happen with ai? Where are our jobs going to go? I don't know. No one knows. We can all guess.

- But what we do know is that you need skills. The skills covered in this roadmap, foundational skills,

- and people still hire for those skills and I think they'll be in demand for a long time. And if they aren't, hey, you'll learn something anyway.

- And I know this roadmap ended up being very specific to hacking. What other roadmaps do you want to see? Cloud engineer, network engineer,

- more blue team, comment below. That's all I got. This is the first video of 2025. I hope you're doing well.

- I'll catch you guys next time.
